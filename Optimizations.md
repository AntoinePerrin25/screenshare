Optimization Recommendations for Screen Sharing Application
Based on the codebase you've shared, here are several optimization strategies that could significantly improve your application's performance:

1. Multithreading Implementation
Your application handles capture, compression, and UI in the same thread, which can cause frame drops:

```c
// Implement a threaded capture system
void InitApplication(AppContext* ctx) {
    // Initialize threading system
    InitThreadPool(3); // For capture, compression, and network threads
    
    // Create capture thread that populates a buffer queue
    CreateThread(CaptureThreadFunction, ctx);
    
    // Create compression thread
    CreateThread(CompressionThreadFunction, ctx);
}
```
2. Memory Management Optimizations
Currently, you're allocating and deallocating memory for each frame:
```c
// Use a double or triple buffer system instead
typedef struct {
    CaptureData buffers[3];
    int writeIndex;
    int readIndex;
    bool bufferFull[3];
    mtx_t mutex;
} CaptureBufferPool;
```
3. Capture Optimization
As mentioned in your README, implementing DXGI would be beneficial:

```c
// In capture.c
CaptureData CaptureDXGI(int monitorIndex) {
    // Use Desktop Duplication API for much faster capture
    // Only process regions that have changed since last frame
}
```

4. Compression Improvements
Your current compression could be enhanced:

```c
// Implement region-based delta compression
void CompressDeltaRegions(CaptureData* current, CaptureData* previous) {
    // Divide screen into grid cells
    // Only compress and transmit cells that changed
    // Use bitmap to track which regions changed
}
```

5. Network Optimization
For future UDP implementation:

```c
// Implement adaptive bitrate based on network conditions
void SendScreenData(CaptureData* data, NetworkStats* stats) {
    // Adjust quality based on packet loss and bandwidth
    int targetQuality = CalculateOptimalQuality(stats->bandwidthKbps, stats->packetLoss);
    
    // Prioritize important screen regions (e.g., where mouse is active)
    // Use FEC for critical regions
}
```

6. Render Loop Optimization
Your render loop could be more efficient:

```c
void RenderApplication(AppContext* ctx) {
    // Only redraw UI elements when their values change
    static int lastFPS = 0;
    if (GetFPS() != lastFPS) {
        lastFPS = GetFPS();
        // Redraw FPS counter
    }
    
    // Reduce string formatting operations
    static char infoBuffer[256];
    // Pre-format strings that don't change every frame
}
```

7. Resource Usage Monitoring
Add performance monitoring to identify bottlenecks:

```c
// Add performance metrics tracking
typedef struct {
    double captureTimeMs;
    double compressionTimeMs;
    double renderTimeMs;
    double networkTimeMs;
    int capturedFrames;
    int transmittedFrames;
    float compressionRatio;
} PerformanceMetrics;
```

Implementing these optimizations should significantly improve your application's performance, especially for high-resolution screen sharing with minimal latency.
